This page explains the fees involved when using VoidDex.

## Fee Overview

| Fee Type | Amount | When Charged |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| VoidDex Protocol | 0.05% | On swap execution |
| Railgun Unshield | 0.25% | When unshielding from private balance |
| Broadcaster | Variable | When using relayer for privacy |
| DEX Swap | 0.01-1% | Varies by DEX and pool |
| Network Gas | Variable | Every transaction |

## VoidDex Protocol Fee

VoidDex charges a 0.05% protocol fee on swap execution. This fee is deducted from the input token amount and helps sustain development and infrastructure costs.

## Broadcaster Fee

When executing private swaps, a broadcaster (relayer) submits your transaction to maintain privacy. The broadcaster charges a fee in WETH for this service. This fee varies based on network gas prices and is displayed before you confirm a swap.

## Gas Fees

You pay network gas fees for all on-chain operations. Shielding requires a transaction to transfer tokens to the Railgun contract. Swapping requires a transaction to execute the private swap. Unshielding requires a transaction to withdraw tokens to a public address. Gas costs vary by network and congestion. On Sepolia testnet, gas is essentially free since you're using testnet ETH.

## Railgun Fees

Railgun charges a 0.25% fee when unshielding tokens from your private balance. Shielding tokens into your private balance is free (no Railgun fee, only gas).

## Cost Example

For a private swap of 1 WETH to USDC:

| Fee Type | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| VoidDex Protocol | 0.0005 WETH | 0.05% of input |
| Broadcaster Fee | ~0.001-0.005 WETH | Varies by gas price |
| DEX Fee | 0.003 WETH | 0.3% (typical Uniswap V3) |
| Network Gas | ~0.002-0.01 ETH | For proof verification |

Total fees are typically 0.5-1% of the swap value, varying based on network congestion and the DEX pools used.

## Minimizing Costs

- Batch operations by shielding larger amounts less frequently
- Keep tokens in your private balance between swaps
- Use L2 networks like Arbitrum for lower gas costs
